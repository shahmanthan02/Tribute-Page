        <p>
            ☛ Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel, commonly known as Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was an Indian
            independence nationalist and barrister who served as the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of
            India from 1947 to 1950. He was a senior leader of the Indian National Congress, who played a significant
            role in the country's struggle for independence and its political integration. In India and elsewhere, he
            was often called Sardar, meaning "Chief" in Hindi, Urdu, Bengali and Persian. He acted as the Home Minister
            during the political integration of India and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.
            <br><br>
        <p>
            ☛ Patel was born in Nadiad, Kheda district and raised in the countryside of the state of Gujarat. He was a
            successful lawyer. 
            <br><br>

            ☛ One of Mahatma Gandhi's earliest political lieutenants, he organised peasants from Kheda,
            Borsad and Bardoli in Gujarat in non-violent civil disobedience against the British Raj, becoming one of the
            most influential leaders in Gujarat. He was appointed as the 49th President of Indian National Congress.
            Under the chairmanship of Patel "Fundamental Rights and Economic Policy" resolution was passed by the
            Congress. Patel's position at the highest level in the Congress was largely connected with his role from
            1934 onwards (when the Congress abandoned its boycott of elections) in the party organisation. Based at an
            apartment in Bombay, he became the Congress's main fundraiser and chairman of its Central Parliamentary
            Board, playing the leading role in selecting and financing candidates for the 1934 elections to the Central
            Legislative Assembly in New Delhi and for the provincial elections of 1936. While promoting the Quit
            India Movement. Patel made a climactic speech to more than 100,000 people gathered at Gowalia Tank in Bombay
            on 7 August 1942. Historians believe that Patel's speech was instrumental in electrifying nationalists, who
            up to then had been sceptical of the proposed rebellion. Patel's organising work in this period is credited
            by historians with ensuring the success of the rebellion across India.
            <br><br>

            ☛ As the first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India, Patel organised relief efforts for partition
            refugees fleeing to Punjab and Delhi from Pakistan and worked to restore peace. Besides those provinces that
            had been under direct British rule, approximately 565 self-governing princely states had been released from
            British suzerainty by the Indian Independence Act of 1947. Patel, together with Nehru and Menon persuaded
            almost every princely state to accede to India.
            <br><br>

            ☛ Patel's commitment to national integration in the newly independent country earned him the sobriquet "Iron
            Man of India". He is also remembered as the "patron saint of India's civil servants" for playing a
            pioneering role in establishing the modern All India Services system. 
            <br><br>

            ☛ The Statue of Unity, the world's tallest statue which was erected by the Indian government at a cost of US$420 million, was dedicated to him
            on 31 October 2018 and is approximately 182 metres (597 ft) in height.
